                        Maybe your bored of your daily cup of muddy water (no offense), or perhaps you once tasted a
                        truly
                        masterful cup of high-mountain oolong and you can't stop thinking about it. The world of tea has
                        a
                        bountiful taste experience waiting for you, but it's hard to know where to start. We can guide
                        you
                        on your journey into species, varieties and sub-varieties. For starters, most people know of at
                        least 2 types of tea, black and green. And while a whole host of other plant species often gets
                        thrown into the mix ( mint, camomile, nettle, ginger etc.) the tea plant is a specific plant,
                        and is
                        the only "real" producer of tea leaves. Everything else that you might call tea is more of an
                        "infusion", or what we might technically call a <strong><em>tisane</em></strong>. On this page
                        we
                        will mostly be talking about
                        actual tea from the tea plant, so if you want to learn all about the "real stuff", read below
                        for
                        more!

                    <p>
                        A lot of people's gateway into the world of tea is attempting to find a healthy alternative to
                        coffee, which we
                        are completely on board with. The need to start the day with a quick fix is real, even in the
                        chilled out world of tea! Many people think that tea is a healthier option because it has less
                        caffeine than coffee and this might feel like more of a self-punishment or sacrifice for the
                        sake of
                        one's health. Well lucky for you we can de-myth this idea. In fact, as well as often having up
                        to 3
                        times as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, a serving of high quality tea has far more benefits
                        than
                        this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other reassurance we'd like to make to those of you who are interested in tea for health, is
                        that
                        healthy tea doesn't have to taste bad! If you've ever had a supermarket tea bag of green tea,
                        well
                        let's just say we can picture your initial expression after tasting it for the first time! But
                        please don't give up on green tea as a result of this unfortunate experience. There are numerous
                        varieties and production methods of green tea, and while not all will be to your taste, there
                        are
                        some truly delicious ones out there! Many of our community members are farmers and tea sellers
                        who
                        offer small tasting packs of different varieties of tea. So invest in some high quality tea
                        leaves
                        and taste the difference!

                        A small, but dedicated subsection of the tea -lovers community, are those that don't just
                        see tea as a beverage, but as a practice, a philosophy and a way of life. As someone who was
                        initially drawn to the cultural expressions and social role of tea in Taiwanese society, I know
                        the
                        depth of this devotion. To many who don't know this side to tea culture, it may seem odd and a
                        bit
                        intense to be so "into" tea. But anyone who understands the value of mindfulness practices and
                        non-material philosophies of life, will eventually see the profound impacts having a tea
                        practice
                        can offer.

                    <p>
                        Many meditation techniques try to cultivate a state of focused-attention in order to improve
                        brain-function, while other techniques focus more on transcendental experiences and cultivating
                        inner calm. Well, tea ceremony can offer all of these benefits, sometimes even within the same
                        session!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it takes some initial skill-learning and practice, once you have the techniques, you can
                        more
                        or less practice on your own every day as part of your morning ritual (which conveniently
                        includes
                        your caffeine hit!), or as part of a group to share the experience.

                    Tea is any leaf produced by the plant "Camellia Sinensis". Within this species there are several
                    varieties but the two that are mostly used to make tea are the Sinensis and Assamica varieties. As
                    you learn more about tea you'll begin to see the significance of these two species and the types of
                    tea they produce, but for now, taking note of which one you are drinking when you try a new tea is a
                    good start!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now to the good stuff, other than our good-old, breakfast, black tea, what are the different tea
                    varieties, how are they produced and what do they taste like?
                    Well, there are 6 main types of tea and they are as follows:
                    White, black, green, yellow, oolong and post-fermented tea sometimes known as "dark tea".
                    Within these 6 types of tea there are numerous varieties. In terms of taste, you can bet that there
                    is as much variety in tea as there are flavours of Italian ice-cream and potentially more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we
                    can't get into all the details of these types and varieties now, below are some clickable resources
                    to start learning and of course you can join our community and sign up to our newsletter for more

                <p>
                    So, what are the health benefits of drinking tea? Firstly, let's talk about the myth that there is
                    less caffeine in tea. Actually, the real reason you don't feel as jittery after a cup of tea is
                    because, along with caffeine, the tea plant is also rich in a compound called L-theanine, which is
                    known to lower blood pressure and give the drinker a calm and clear-minded feeling.
                </p>
                <p>There are
                    numerous health benefits that are associated with L-theanine alone, but most high quality teas
                    contain many other valuable compounds, such as catechins, anitoxidants and polyphenols. According to
                    research, regularly drinking tea containing these compounds can boost metabolism, regulate
                    blood-sugar, reduce blood-pressure, improve skin health, fight against anti-aging as well as
                    mitigate the effects of sun damage. This is not to mention the exciting research coming out of the
                    University of Salford that suggests not only does tea help prevent cancer, but Matcha tea in
                    particular may be able to kill cancer stem cells!
                </p>
                <p> Speaking of Matcha, most people associate health
                    with green tea varieties. While it's true that Matcha probably has the lion's share of health
                    benefits due to the fact that you are actually consuming the leaf, we can assure you that, if like
                    many people, green tea is not to your taste, all tea varieties have similar health benefits and
                    potentially various unknown others, since there has been a lack of research on the health benefits
                    of other varieties thanks to green tea stealing the show somewhat!

                    Oftentimes, traditional meditation can feel like a means to an end, intentionally done to get a
                    specific result. It takes effort, and if you have any little demons running around in your mind, it
                    can be uncomfortable. Tea ceremony can offer an effective alternative to meditation which is not so
                    mind-focused. In tea ceremony, there is only making, serving and drinking tea. Yet somehow,
                    without realising, or even trying, one has achieved focused-attention, calmness and inner-peace. And
                    if the atmosphere is right, one can even experience a profound sense of <em>being</em> and a
                    gratitude for
                    life. And all the while, there is a delicious cup of tea waiting for you at the end.
                </p>
                <p>

                    For those who are interested there is much to learn in tea ceremony. There are many different
                    practices, some more formal, some more meditative, some focused on the spiritual principles of Zen
                    Buddhism or Taoism, and some even verging on the informal and social styles. There are regional
                    differences and within those, there are different schools with different techniques and styles.
                    There are also various tea implements and teaware that sometimes require quite technical skills to
                    master.
