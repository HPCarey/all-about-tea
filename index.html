                Whether you're a seasoned tea lover or a curious beginner, you probably already know that there is so
                much more to tea than tea bags.
                At <em>All About Tea</em>, we are passionate about spreading knowledge related to all aspects of tea and
                tea practices.

                    If you came here for taste:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Maybe your bored of your daily cup of muddy water (no offense), or perhaps you once tasted a truly
                    masterful cup of high mountain oolong and you can't get it off your mind. The world of tea has a
                    bountiful taste experience waiting for you, but it's hard to know where to start. We can guide you
                    on your journey into species, varieties and sub-varieties. For starters, most people know of at
                    least 2 types of tea, black and green. And while a whole host of other plant species often gets
                    thrown into the mix ( mint, camomile, nettle, ginger etc.) the tea plant is a specific plant, and is
                    the only "real" producer of tea leaves.
                    Tea is any leaf produced by the plant "Camellia Sinensis". Within this species there are several
                    varieties but the two that are mostly used to make tea are the Sinensis and Assamica varieties. As
                    you learn more about tea you'll begin to see the significance of these two species and the types of
                    tea they produce, but for now, taking note of which one you are drinking when you try a new tea is a
                    good start!

                <h3>
                    If you came here for health:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of people's gateway into the world of tea is finding a healthy alternative to coffee, which we
                    are completely on board with. The need to start the day with a quick fix is real, even in the
                    chilled out world of tea! Many people think that tea is a healthier option because it has less
                    caffeine than coffee and this might feel like more of a self-punishment or sacrifice for the sake of
                    one's health. Well lucky for you we can de-myth this idea. In fact, as well as often having up to 3
                    times as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, a serving of high quality tea has far more benefits than
                    this. For instance, the reason you don't feel as wired after a cup of tea is that, along with
                    caffeine, the tea plant is also rich in a compound called L-theanine, which is known to lower blood
                    pressure and give the drinker a calm and clear-minded feeling.
                    The other reassurance we'd like to make to those of you who are interested in tea for health is that
                    healthy tea doesn't have to taste bad! If you've ever had a supermarket tea bag of green tea, well
                    let's just say we can picture your initial expression after tasting it for the first time! But
                    please don't give up on green tea as a result of this unfortunate experience. There are numerous
                    varieties and production methods of green tea, and while not all will be to your taste, there are
                    some truly delicious ones out there! Many of our community members are farmers and tea sellers who
                    offer small tasting packs of different varieties of tea. So invest in some high quality tea leaves
                    and taste the difference!

                <h3>
                    If you came here for a mindful tea practice:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Perhaps a small, but dedicated subsection of the tea -lovers community, are those that don't just
                    see tea as a beverage, but as a practice, a philosophy and a way of life. As someone who was
                    initially drawn to the cultural expressions and social role of tea in Taiwanese society, I know the
                    depth of this devotion. To many who don't know this side to tea culture, it may seem odd and a bit
                    intense to be so "into" tea. But anyone who understands the value of mindfulness practices and
                    non-material philosophies of life, will eventually see the profound impacts having a tea practice
                    can offer.
                    Many meditation techniques try to cultivate a state of focused-attention in order to improve
                    brain-function, while other techniques focus more on transcendental experiences and cultivating
                    inner calm. Well, tea ceremony can offer both of these within the same session! Similarly, if you
                    have trouble with traditional methods of meditation, perhaps due to trauma, anxiety or
                    neurobehavioural reasons like adhd, tea ceremony can offer an effective alternative which is not so
                    mind-focused.
                    While it takes some initial skill-learning and practice, once you have the techniques, you can more
                    or less practice on your own every day as part of your morning ritual (which conveniently includes
                    your caffeine hit!), or as part of a group to share the experience.
