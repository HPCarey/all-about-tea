## Site-Overview
All About Tea is a website dedicated to spreading information and education about tea and tea culture. It's purpose is to help popularise higher quality and healthier tea products, grown by small farmers and indigineous people, as well as to promote the more ceremonial and mindful tea practices that exist in eastern tea cultures, but which haven't quite taken off in the west yet. With meditation and mindfulness movements becoming more and more prominent in western society, All About Tea hopes to be one of the pioneering sources of the "Tea Movement" in the English speaking world. It's more immediate aim is to educate users and to build an online community around this somewhat niche hobby.


## Planning Stage

### Intended Users
The website is intended for a variety of users:
* Those who already have some knowledge and interest in tea and who wish to learn more and become involved in a global, online community who share the same interest.
* Beginners or "newbies" who have a curiosity and a desire to learn more about tea and tea culture, but who haven't yet developed this interest in a practical way.
* Those who are interested in higher quality tea for health reasons.
* Those who are looking for a meditative/mindful practice who have problems focusing and sitting in traditional meditation.

### User Stories
* As a visiting user, I want a quick, general intorduction to the topics.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate to the section with the information I am seeking.
* As a user, I want to have learned something about the topic for which I visited the website.
* As a user, I want to be given navigation links to other resources that go more in depth on the topic that interests me most.
* As a user, I want the opportunity to connect with like-minded people and to become part of a community.

### Site aims
 1. The website will give users a general intorduction to tea related topics and will provide links to external sources and other websites for further education on each specific topic.   

2. The site will promote Tea Culture and encourage users to explore all aspects of tea, from the physical health benefits, to the meditative and ceremonial qualities as well as the taste experience of different varieties of tea.

3. The site will offer users the opportunity to become members and recieve monthly educational articles and updates of events and meetup opportunites (both online and face to face events) around the world. 

### Wireframes:
Althoug I know it was not a requirement, I used wireframes to help me visualise and conceptualise the features and layout of the website and it really helped me to create a solid image in my mind of how the webiste would function and look. It was also really useful in terms of getting feedback from my mentor on what would work and what wouldn't.

### Colour Scheme
 The first step for creating the colour scheme was to uplaod the hero image to [colormind](http://colormind.io/image/) and generate a few different palettes and copy the hex values.

 The next step was to go to input these hex values into the contrast grid on [Eightshapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to check the WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast scores which helped me to pick a background and foreground colour that meet the accessibility requirements for good UX.

 ### Typogrophy

 The first step for choosing the font was to got to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and type my website title to see which font had the style I was going for. I wanted something simple and with soft edges, so I ended up choosing Dosis.
 
Next I did a quick google search to see which fonts were commonly paired with Dosis.

 Finally, I used [pairfonts](https://pairfonts.com/) to decide which font I wanted to pair with it. I chose lato and with the intention of experimenting between regular and italicized. The clean lines and simplicity matched Dosis well and was the style I was going for with my website.

## Features
### Existing features
#### Navigation bar
The navigation bar is featured on all pages of the site. For simplicity and for a better UX, I designed the site from a section based approach. This means all the sections, with the exception of the community and validation pages, are on the same webpage which is scrollable. For this reason I made the nav bar sticky and tried to make it as thin as possible.The nav bar is fully responsive and links to the Home, About, Tea and Community sections. The Validation page can only be accessed once the form on the Community section has been filled in and submitted with the correct input type. 

#### logo
#### footer
The footer is fully reposive and features at the bottom of each individual webpage. 

It contains social media links which open  in a new tab for good UX. Although this is a made up website, in theory it is largely an online community, so social media is a big part of it's online presence in terms of connecting people, sharing ideas and orgainsing and promoting events.

#### Landing page
The landing page features the hero image below of a farmer's hand sifting through freshly picked tea leaves, which sets the tone and gives the user an idea of the kind of content the site provides. There is also a welcome heading and a short text about the site and inviting users to explore.

#### About section
The About section goes into more detail introducing the site to users and explaining what type of information and resources they will find. It also invites users to join the community by signing up for the monthly newsletter. This section features a video which encourages users to embrace a more mindful and meditative tea culture.

#### Tea
This section contains the main content of the site and is divided into three parts; tea varieties, tea ceremony and health. Each section has a heading, an image and some text about the topic. Beneath the text are some links to external resources and an embedded video related to the topic.

This section also contains the footer with social media links.

#### Community
This section contains a second hero image as a background image, a heading with some text explaining about the community and how to get involved. Below this is a form where users can become members to get accesss to past articles and newsletter as well as to the online All About Tea community chat and message board. They have the option to subscribe to the monthly newleatter to receive news about tea production and sales, as well as events and featured articles. There is also a Contact section featuring an email, phone number and address for the base of operations in Dublin, as well as an embedded google maps location.  

#### Validatio page
This page displays a "Thank You" message once users have signed up to become members. iT feature the same hero image as the community page and the same contact information and map. 

### Features left to implement
As this is a community page and as suggested in the Community section, one of the features of this site would be a message board and live chat feature.

As the community grows, there would also be an events page where members and businesses could promote their tea events and meetups.

There is also potential for a products page where member and non-member users could purchase tea and teaware.
